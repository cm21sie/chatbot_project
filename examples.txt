Question: How many first year modules are available?
Answer: There are 8 modules available in first year.

Question: Are there any first year modules assessed by 100% coursework?

Question: Summarise what topics are covered across all first year modules.
Answer:
    - atomic structure and periodic trends
    - chemical bonding and the periodic table
    - basic physical chemistry (gas laws, kinetics, equilibrium, thermodynamics)
    - acids, bases, and ionic behaviour in solution
    - fundamentals of organic chemistry and carbon bonding
    - introduction to chemical analysis techniques
    - spectroscopy (UV-vis, IR, NMR, mass spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography)
    - chromatography (GC and HPLC basics)
    - structure identification using spectroscopic data
    - scientific skills: poster creation, ChemDraw, and online molecular research
    - mechanisms and electron movement in organic reactions

Question: Are there any modules specifically about acid rain?
Answer: There are no modules that are entirely about acid rain, however, there are modules that contain this topic within them such as CHEM3185: Atmospheric Chemistry.

Question: How do you know which modules are third year modules?
Answer: The module codes help determine which year the module takes place in. Those starting with a 3, for example, CHEM3211, are third year modules.
